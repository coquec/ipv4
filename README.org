* ipv4

** What is it?

ipv4 is an Emacs package with functions to manipulate IPv4 network addresses.

** How to install

The package is available as source code in a Git repository.  You can add the
following lines to your init file for Emacs 29.x or 30.x versions:

#+NAME: Init code to install the package with use-package
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results output none
  (let ((ipv4-repo "https://github.com/coquec/ipv4.git"))
    (if (< emacs-major-version 30)
        (package-vc-install ipv4-repo :last-release)
      (use-package ipv4
        :vc
        (:url ipv4-repo :branch "main" :rev :newest))))
  (use-package ipv4
    :vc
    (:url "https://github.com/coquec/ipv4.git" :branch "main" :rev :newest))
#+END_SRC

In older ~use-package~ versions that don't support the ~:vc~ parameter, you
should clone the repository and load the ipv4.el file manually.

** How to use it

The library supports IPv4 addresses in strings for hosts ("192.168.13.10"), or
networks in CIDR format ("10.141.92.13/24").  It provides functions to convert
them to/from integers, as shown in the following examples:

#+NAME: Convert an IP address to an integer
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results output none
  (message "#x%x" (ipv4-string-to-int "192.168.13.10"))
#+END_SRC

#+NAME: Show information from a network in CIDR format
#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp :results output none
  (let ((net (ipv4-cidr-to-cons "192.168.13.10/23")))
    (message
     "Network: %s/%d\nMask: %s\nBroadcast: %s\nWildcard: %s\nHost count: %d\nFirst host: %s"
     (ipv4-int-to-string (ipv4-network net))
     (cdr net)
     (ipv4-int-to-string (ipv4-cidr-to-mask (cdr net)))
     (ipv4-int-to-string (ipv4-broadcast net))
     (ipv4-int-to-string (ipv4-cidr-to-wildcard (cdr net)))
     (ipv4-host-count net)
     (ipv4-int-to-string (ipv4-first-host net))))
#+END_SRC
